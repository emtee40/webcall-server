<h2>How to use</h2>

<h3 id="makingcalls">Making calls</h3>

To make a phone call you only need a modern web-browser (2020+) and a WebCall link.
This is what a WebCall link looks like:<br><br>
<div style="color:#ff0;padding-left:20px;">https://timur.mobi/user/592510240</div><br>

A WebCall link functions like a phone number.
If someone sends you a WebCall link, you can call this person right away.
You only need to open the link in a Web browser and click the Call button.
<br><br>
This is what you see when you are connected:
<br><br>
<img src="caller.png" style="width:80%; border:solid #888;">
<br><br>


<h3 id="calleeid">Receiving calls</h3>

WebCall can act like a "plain old telephony system" where you operate
a permanent phone and everybody else can call you.
<br><br>

If you want to talk to someone and you have no WebCall link
of that person, you can share your own WebCall link and ask to be called back.
You can generate a WebCall link for yourself via the
<a href="http://timur.mobi/callee/register">WebCall callee service</a>.
All you need to do is to enter a password.
The process can be completed in a few seconds.
You will receive two custom links in return.
The first is your callee link, which allows you to receive calls.
A sample WebCall callee link:<br><br>
<div style="color:#ff0;padding-left:20px;">https://timur.mobi/callee/592510240</div>
<br>
When you open your callee link and receive a call, this is what you will see:
<br><br>
<img src="callee.png" style="width:90%; border:solid #888;">
<br><br><br>

The second link you get is a regular WebCall user link (as shown
under "Making calls").
You can share your WebCall user link with anyone.
And anyone who knows your WebCall user link can give you a call.
<br><br>

Sharing a WebCall link is like sharing a phone number.
One thing that is different on the Web, is that only one side
(the callee) needs to have a "phone number".
<br><br>


<h3 id="duo">Option 3: One-time telephony link</h3>

If you need a single-use WebCall link (good for one phone call),
you can get one via the
<a href="https://timur.mobi/user/duo">WebCall Duo</a> service.
You do not need to enter a password or anything else.

Share the generated link with someone,
either by email or some other messaging system,
and tell the person to "open this link to give me a call."
You can then sit back and wait for your browser to start ringing.
<br><br>

WebCall Duo makes you a callee for a single call.
You can use it as often as you like, but it is like switching
sim cards every time.
If you need a more permanent solution, have a look at option 2.
<br><br>


<h3>Option 4: Call Roulette</h3>

You can also play
<a href="http://timur.mobi/user/random">Call Roulette</a>
where you will get connected to a random caller for a one-on-one phone conversation.
<br>

<h2 id="e2ee">End-to-end Encryption</h2>
The two WebCall clients (caller and callee) create standard WebRTC 1.0 connections.
The WebCall signaling server (or rendesvouz server) is assisting the two clients in
doing so.
If a peer-to-peer connection cannot be established, the signaling server will also
host a relayed connection, so calls will always go through.
The data connection is encrypted by the two clients alone.
There is no way for any other party, including the WebCall signaling server, to
"look inside" the actual data stream.
You can look at the deployed WebCall client source code and verify these claims:
<br><br>

<div style="margin-left:20px">
<a href="https://timur.mobi/user/caller.js">https://timur.mobi/user/caller.js</a><br>
<a href="https://timur.mobi/callee/callee.js">https://timur.mobi/callee/callee.js</a><br>
</div>


<h2 id="p2p">Peer-to-Peer or Relayed</h2>

A WebRTC audio connections between two clients is made up of two fully independent data links.
The two browsers will only provide access to a connection when both links have been
established, so it looks like one. But under the hood we are dealing with two separate links:
your audio traveling to the other side and the other parties audio traveling towards
your device.
<br><br>

Both links may fail to establish a peer-to-peer connection.
Or one will be p2p, while the other will be relayed.
WebCall will let you know what is going on by showing a connect indicator that
contains one of the following strings: "p2p/p2p", "p2p/relayed" or "relayed/p2p".
The link type on the left side is for the audio traveling from you to
the other side.
<br><br>
If a p2p connection cannot be established, the problem is most often caused by
NAT devices deployed by the ISP's involved.
If you often get relayed connections, you may want to try using WebCall via a
different ISP.
The disadvantage of a relayed connection is a slightly longer ping duration.



<h2 id="soundquality">Audiophile Sound Quality</h2>
WebCall let's you talk to a person on another continent and it
provides exceptional sound quality while doing so.
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left:20px">
"When I talk to someone on the phone, I really like to be able
to make out nuances in their voice. Communicating becomes much
richer this way." -Timur
</div>
<br>
But if the sound quality is so good, why am I told to wear a headset?
The reason is: you don't want to spoil the excellent sound quality
with echos and echo cancellation effects.
<br><br>
If you have a 100ms delay from one side to the other (not too much by itself),
and the person you talk to does not wear a headset, your voice will exit the
speaker and enter the microphone on the other side and it will travel back,
arriving in your speaker after 200ms. An echo like this is very annoying,
which is why there is echo cancellation in place to prevent it.
But echo cancellation never works perfectly. It tends to cut out short
periods of audio, which often makes it difficult to fully understand all
the words being said.
<br><br>
If both side wear a headset, echos don't occur and echo cancellation
will not be activated. Only then will you get the full benefits of
audiophile telephony.
