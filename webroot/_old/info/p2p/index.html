<h1>WebCall HQ - P2P</h1>

WebRTC is a technology that can take advantage of direct peer-to-peer connections.
But often it is not possible to establish a truely direct connection between two remote peers. 
Most of the time these issues are caused by network components called NAT's
(or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">Network address translators</a>).
You can read more about the problems these devices can cause in 
<a href="https://dh2i.com/kbs/kbs-2961448-understanding-different-nat-types-and-hole-punching/">
this excellent article.</a>
<br><br>

In short: whether a direct p2p connection can be established, or not,
depends on the particular type of NAT devices situated between you and your 
telephony counterpart. 
Certain combinations of NAT devices simply make p2p connections impossible.
In the article above you can find an online 
<a href="https://clients.dh2i.com/NatTest/">NAT testing tool.</a>
This tool let's you find out about the type of NAT deployed by your ISP.
<br><br>

When using WebCall HQ, whether you make or receive calls, you will see information
about the type of connection that has been established.
You may wonder why this information is split in two parts, like so:
"p2p/p2p", "p2p/relay", "relay/p2p".
<br><br>

The reason for this is that WebRTC connections are bidirectional.
And the two data-links do often not take the same path.
In WebCall HQ, the left segment refers to the path your audio-stream is taking 
towards the other side.
And the right segment refers to the path the audio-stream of the other party 
takes towards you.
<br><br>

Whenever a true p2p connection cannot be established, one or both data-streams
need to be relayed.
WebCall HQ takes full care of this. One thing to note here is that no 3rd 
party servers are being used for managing and delivering calls made with WebCall HQ.
As a result, no (meta) data will leak out to other parties.
<br><br>

One advantage of a direct p2p-link is lower latency.
For instance 80ms, instead of 160ms with a relayed connection.
But 160ms is still very quick.
And in most cases you will not be able to tell the difference.
