<h1>Call Button - Telephony for Websites</h3>

When you add a telephony call button to your website,
your online visitors will be able to call you quickly
and conveniently over the web.
Here we demonstrate the sound quality of these calls and show you
how you can quickly add a call button to your own website.
<br><br>

Call buttons work like regular WebCall telephony.
The main differece is, that the user will stay on your website
the whole time.
<br><br>

All call buttons on this page create live WebRTC telephony calls.
There are, however, no live operators answering these calls.
Instead, we play back different audio content over RTC.
This way you can hear the sound quality of WebCall telephony.
When you deploy a call button on your website, this is how you will
sound like to your callers.
<br><br><br>


<h2>Example: Pizza Order Page</h2>
<iframe src="pizzahouse-demo" id="wcbutton2" frameborder='no' style="width:1000px; height:630px;"></iframe>
<br><br><br><br>


<h2>Example: Callcenter</h2>
<iframe src="callcenter-demo" id="wcbutton2" frameborder='no' style="width:1000px; height:492px;"></iframe>
<br><br>
It is also possible to use a single call button for multiple callees.
You can find all the core info about WebCall <a href="/webcall/info">here.</a>
<br><br><br>


<h2>Add a Call Button to your own Website</h2>
Use the following HTML:
<br><br>

<div class="markup">&lt;iframe src="https://timur.mobi/button/12345678" allow="microphone" style="width:240px; height:84px;" scrolling="no" frameborder="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</div>
<br>

Your website must be accesible via https for this to work.
Otherwise the WebRTC subsystem in the browser will not
permit access to the microphone.
The user clicking on the button must separately permit access to the microphone.
<br><br>

You can change the width and height of the button to fit your needs.
You can also replace the button text labels.
In the following example we use "readyText=" and "connectedText=" arguments
to change two of the four default labels. (There are also "connectingText=" and "busyText=".)
<br><br>

<div class="markup">&lt;iframe src="https://timur.mobi/button/1234567890?readyText=Click here to give us a call &amp;connectedText=Connection established&lt;br&gt;How can we help you?" allow="microphone" style="width:240px; height:84px;" scrolling="no" frameborder="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</div>
<br>
In order to receive the calls made with your call button,
you need to replace the "1234567890" sample ID with your own caller ID.
In other words: You need to provide your own WebCall "phone number."
<br><br>
This is how you can get your own callee ID:
<br><br>

1. Obtain a custom callee ID from the <a href="/callee/register">WebCall HQ service.</a>
You need to enter a password to protect your callee ID.
You don't need to provide any other information.
Two custom WebCall links will be generated for you in return.
Both will contain your custom callee ID.
The first link lets you receive calls. Click on it to start the callee app.
This is where you can receive your calls.
To get access you need to enter your password again.
Once you have successfully logged in you should bookmark this page for later use.
Here you can also find the second link, your WebCall user link.
Others can use this link to give you a call.
<br><br>

2. Now start a web browser on a second device and open your WebCall user link there.
Hit the call button whenever you are ready.
When you do this your first device should start ringing.
Answer the call with the Answer button.
<br><br>

3. Once you are able to receive calls, you can replace the sample "1234567890"
string in the button HTML with your custom 10-digit callee ID.
With this in place you should be able to click the button on your website
and the calls should arrive on the device where you are running the WebCall
callee app.
<br><br>


<h2>Collapsing the Call Button when you go Offline</h2>

When you go offline and cannot answer calls, the call button on your website
will automatically switch off.
Your online visitors will NOT run into a situation where they try to
call you when no one is there to answer.
But the button area will just go blank.
It will not collapse all by itself.
<br><br>
It is possible to make the button area fully collapse,
should this be required for layout purposes.
The trick is to hide (display:none) the button in it's default state.
And to make it automatically visible, when you are available to receive calls.
This can be achieved with 10-15 lines of Javascript.

Look for <b>function extMessage</b> in the source code of this page:<br><br>
<a style="margin-left:20px;" href="..">https://timur.mobi/webcall/index.html</a><br><br>

It basically works like this: When a user loads the page, the Javascript code in the
HTML document will post a "reqActiveNotification" message to the iframe child.
The iframe child will then post a "activeNotification" message back to the <b>extMessage</b> handler
when the specified callee-ID is online.
When <b>extMessage</b> receives the "activeNotification" message, it will make the button visible.
